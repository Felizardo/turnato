This game is a 4x4 variant of the classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.  In this game, we have introduced a new symbol - the Murti of Shreeji Maharaj, which represents both a cross and a circle.

Each time a player takes their turn, there is a 1-in-6 chance of Murti being placed instead of cross or circle.  

Note: The wildcard (the plus) can appear up to a maximum of three times per game.
