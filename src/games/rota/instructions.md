Rota is a two-player game. The board has 8 cells placed equidistantly along a circle, and a 9th cell in the center. The game begins with each player having 3 pieces of their respective color. The players alternately place their 3 pieces on any of the 9 cells on the board. Once all pieces have been placed, the players move them around trying to form a line of 3 pieces either along the circumference or along the diameter. The players cannot jump over the opponentâ€™s pieces.
