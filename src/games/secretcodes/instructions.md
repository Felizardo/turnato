Shreeji's Secret is a very misterious game through which you can test your satsang related knowledge. The game has two teams, blue and red, and within each team there is a leader called the gyan-master.

Only the gyan-master knows which cards need to be selected by their teammates. However, gyan-master can only give one sentence and a number as a clue to their team. 

The objective is for the rest of the team to figure out all their secret words before the gyan given by their gyan-master. And they need to be careful, choosing a black card will lead to immediately losing the game!
