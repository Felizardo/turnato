Estate Buyer is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.

Phase 1: Buying Buildings
Turn face up a number of building cards equal to the number of players. Then all buildings will be auctioned at the same time, so that no player goes empty handed. Each player can now bid or pass.

Bidding: The player who lives in the smallest house begins and lays one or more of his chips in the middle. Others follow suit, but must bid more than the present highest bid. Bidding continues for as many rounds as necessary until all players have passed.

Passing: If a player passes, he no longer bids and takes the building with the lowest value. He also takes back half his bid rounded down. The rest goes to the bank. The last player remaining takes the highest value building but pays all his chips. Note: It is not necessary to bid anything to gain the least valuable building.

Buildings gained are placed face down in front of each player. The player taking the most valuable building turns over the next set of replacement cards for auction, and bids again, or passes. This continues until all buildings have been sold. Unused chips are kept. They will be worth one million each.

Phase 2: Selling Buildings
Now the checks are used. As in Phase 1, the same number of checks will be turned face up. Each player takes his buildings in his hand and plays 1 card face down in front of him. These are turned over simultaneously. The player who has played the most valuable building card takes the biggest check. The player with the second most valuable card takes the second biggest check etc. Building cards are discarded.

Game End
The game ends when all players have sold their buildings. Players add up their checks and chips (1 million each), and the richest player wins. Ties are resolved in favor of the player with the most chips.
