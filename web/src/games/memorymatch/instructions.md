This is a simple memory game where you need to match pairs of cards. Initially, all card are closed, and in a given turn the player is allowed to flip two cards. If the player opens matching cards, he/she gets to open two more cards until two non-matching cards are opened. The player to open the most matching pairs of card wins.
