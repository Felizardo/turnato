Tic-Tac-Toe Plus (ttt+) is a 4x4 variant of the classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.  While the 4x4 variant of Tic-Tac-Toe is considered to be biased and frequently lead to a draw, Tic-Tac-Toe **Plus** introduces a wildcard symbol (namely the *plus* symbol), which represents both a circle **and** a cross.

Each time a player takes their turn, there is a 1-in-6 chance of a wildcard symbol being placed.  

Note: The wildcard (the plus) can appear up to a maximum of three times per game.
