This game 'Secret Dracula' is an interpretaion of 'Secret Hitler'. See
https://www.secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf for the rules of Secret Hitler. The differences between 'Secret Hitler' and 'Secret Dracula' are mainly cosmetic, as the rules of the game remain the same.

A GAME OF DECITE, LIES AND VAMPIRES!

In Secret Dracula, there are two group of players, the vampires and the rest of the village. One of the vampires is Dracula. Even though Vampires are a minority, they know each other identities, while villagers do not.

On each turn, one player is a mayor candidate, and picks another player to be a priest. Then, the elected mayor gets to discard one of three cards that can be either blood (favoring vampires) or a village card. The elected priest then picks one of the two cards left to be enacted as a policy. 

Villagers win by passing 5 village policies, or killing the Dracula. Vampires win by passing 6 vampire policies, or passing 3 policies and electing Dracula as mayor.
