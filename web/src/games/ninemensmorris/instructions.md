Shreeji Mills is a very good two-player board game. This game is played in two phases, as described below:

1. In the first phase of the game, each player has to place Murtis on empty slots. If a player places three Murtis in a line, they form a "mill", and they can remove an opponent's Murti from the board. The first phase ends when 9 Murtis are placed by each player.

2. In the second phase, each player can move a Murti to an adjacent point, as long as the adjacent point is empty (no jumping). As in the first phase, forming a mill removes one opponent's Murti.

The game ends when a player only has two Murtis left.
