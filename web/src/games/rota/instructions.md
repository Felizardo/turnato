Rass is a simple two-player game, which can send you back in the Smruti of Shreeji Maharaj playing Rass in Panchala. The board has 8 points placed equidistantly along the rass-circle, and a 9th point in the center. The game begins with each player having 3 murti of Shreeji or Saint. The players alternately place their 3 Murti on any of the 9 points on the board. Once all Murtis have been placed, the players move them around trying to form a line of 3 Murtis either along the circumference or along the diameter. The players cannot jump over the opponentâ€™s Murti.
