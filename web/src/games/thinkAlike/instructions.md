The objective of the game is to be the first team to reach the end marker. Form a team comprising of two players each and start the game. The topic for which the cards are to be picked is randomly picked by the computer and you shall pick cards correponding to that topic. Line up the picked cards with your strongest pick first and the weakest pick last.

Once all the teams have their cards picked, then click okay and your cards will be reveiled and score will be calculated. If both players picked a card that has the same image and are ordered in the same spot so the cards are directly across from one another, a direct match, each match is worth 3 points. If the teammates picked an identical card but the order isn’t in the same spot, an indirect match, each of those matches is worth 2 points. Cards that don’t match are worth 0 points. The number of spaces you move forward on the board equals the number of points you score. The new number you land on determines how many cards you pick that turn. If you scored zero points, you do not move. 

At some places in the board you have the chance to get double points, only if the first card selected by both team players is the same.
