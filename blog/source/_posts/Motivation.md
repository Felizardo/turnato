Board games are an increasingly popular way to have fun with friends. However, this intellectually stimulating leisure activity is only widespread in specific regions of the world. Before moving to one of these regions, I was not even aware that they existed. This project aims to change this reality by increasing the availability of board games, and by making them easier to play remotely. Even though nothing will ever replace the real life experience of sitting with friends in the same room, we can leverage the ubiquity of mobile devices to make playing board games a more common activity around the world.

Creating digital versions of board games is a very common hobby for developers, but most of these efforts are siloed and fragmented. This project intends on creating the necessary infrastructure to make it easy for the community to develop high-quality board games implementations for mobile devices. By making the project free (as in freedom) and joining efforts with others like [Boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io) we hope that, together, we can make a positive impact in the world, and show how fun and intellectually stimulating board games can be.

Therefore, this blog will contain materials like tutorials and other fun stuff related to [freeboardgame.org](https://freeboardgame.org) and [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io) :). Soon we will post a tutorial on how to develop a simple game (tic-tac-toe), leverage the boardgame.io framework, and publish the game to freeboardgame.org.
