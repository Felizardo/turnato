Checkers is a board game for two players. It is played in a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side.

Each player starts with twelve Murtis in white-background. Normally, a players Murti (with white-background) can move only diagonally towards the opponent's side, while Murtis with blue-background can move in any direction. A player can remove an opponent's Murti from the board by jumping over it.

In order to jump, the next diagonal square after the opponent Murti must be empty. If the player has more than one possible jump, these jumps can be executed in a single turn. A Murti get a blue-background if it reaches the last row of the opponent. The game ends when no more Murtis or moves are left for a player.
