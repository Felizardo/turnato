Hangman is a well-know two player game. In this game, a player is asked to guess a word, given its character length and a hint. The player tries to guess the characters in the word and is allowed to make upto 10 incorrect guesses. If the players guesses the word correctly, the final score is the ratio of the number of correct guesses and the total number of guesses made. If more than 10 incorrect guesses were made, the final score is zero.
